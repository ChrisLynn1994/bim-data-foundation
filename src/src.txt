# Phase 0 — Week 2 Summary
## Ingestion Phase Lock

The objective of Week 2 was to ingest real BIM data
into a pandas-based inspection environment
without performing any cleaning or transformation.

### Data Source

This project uses a real BIM export (CSV) generated from Revit models
(host + linked models).

The export represents design-time / as-built BIM data
prior to any cleaning or transformation.

### Ingestion Status

- Raw BIM export stored under `data/raw/`
- CSV successfully loaded into pandas
- Column names verified against schema_v0
- No transformations or cleaning applied yet

This concludes the ingestion phase.

### 1. Real BIM Data Ingestion

- A real BIM export was selected as the data source
- Raw CSV was stored without modification
- Pandas successfully loaded the dataset

### 2. Schema vs Raw Validation

- All schema_v0 columns exist in raw data
- No extra or missing columns detected
- Column naming matches exactly

### 3. Initial Data Quality Snapshot

- High null rates observed in geometric fields
- Mixed physical and non-physical elements detected
- No data was removed or altered

| Criteria | Status |
|--------|--------|
| real data ingested | ✅ |
| pandas ingestion complete | ✅ |
| schema alignment verified | ✅ |
| data untouched | ✅ |

Week 2 ingestion phase is complete and locked.
All further changes must be applied through
explicit cleaning rules starting Week 3.
